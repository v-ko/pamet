Misli
===========
 A program for organizing your thoughts and notes. The notes are resizeable and you can pick from several colors. To visualize semantics you can link the notes to one another. The notes are stored in note files, which are stored in one or more directories (so when there's a lot of stuff it can be well organized). Switching between note files can be done via button-like notes, much like the hyperlinks on the internet.

### Timeline
A diary module that allows making daily entries or summeries for longer periods of time. There's a direct link to the browsed day in Google Timeline, experimental support for showing FB conversations for the day (extracted from a downloaded FB archive). Showing images from your photo library for the browsed period (currently broken). But the text diary functionality is stable. The ambition is to have all kinds of sources of personal logs and information be browsable from Timeline.
