# Pamet
An infinite canvas for organizing information with text/images/links. Written using Qt for Python.

⚠ **Still in alpha** ⚠ - you'll probably encounter GUI bugs, but the data storage/saving is stable.

## Installation

### Windows options
- From the [Windows store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PB9T7G1PMSR)
- By downloading the static build from [the Releases page](https://github.com/v-ko/pamet/releases/)

### Via pip
Requires Python `>3.10`. If it's not available for your package manager(/app store) - you can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

`pip install pamet` , start with `pamet`

### From source
- Clone the [Fusion](https://github.com/v-ko/fusion) and Pamet repos.
- Run `pip install .` (with the respective repo as current working dir).
    * If you want a development install run `pip install -e .` instead. Install Fusion first (otherwise it'll get pulled from PyPI). Also it would be best to do it in a virtual environment if you want to run the release version in parallel

- A Flatpak is in the works but I hit an [issue](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5103) there.

## Usage
- Ctrl+shift+P for the command palette
- Double click to create a new note
- L to craete an arrow
- Click to select
- Long-press and drag to move selected notes/arrows
- Ctrl or shift to select multiple notes
- Ctrl+Shift to drag-select multiple notes
- Drag the lower right corner of a note to resize it
- Buttons 1,2,3,4 change the note color. 5 removes the background
* Selected notes get moved together and resized to the same size
* No manual saving is required
- Copy/paste/cut work as you'd expect
- Paste special with ctrl+shift+V (imports links and multiple notes) - will be improved

## Testing
There are unit tests for some of the functionality and testing for the actions(=controller) which are not precise but are quite useful for visual verification (+are [easy to generate](tests/actions/new_test_HOW_TO.md)).

## Development state and future
Check some notes on the [development so far](development-history.md)

Currently the code documentation isn't updated, and typing annotations have to be completed in places.

Next goals in terms of features:
- Server for page sharing
- A minimal web app for viewing pages
- A minimal android app for viewing and limited input
