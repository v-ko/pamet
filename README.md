Misli
===========
 A program for organizing your thoughts and notes. The notes are resizeable and you can pick from several colors. To visualize semantics you can link the notes to one another. The notes are stored in note files, which are stored in one or more directories (so when there's a lot of stuff it can be well organized). Switching between note files can be done via button-like notes, much like the hyperlinks on the internet.

List of features
---------------------
- Real-time detection of file changes (if you're using some type of file synchronization)
- Hyperlinks between note files
- Adding pictures
- Displaying text files on the file system as notes
- System call notes: executing a shell command by double clicking on the note and receiving the output as a new note below
