  <summary>An app for personal note organization</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        The app features map-like navigation, multiple pages with hyperlinking,
        note moving/resize, limited (as of now) style changes. The notes can
        hold an image, text, link. There's also a backup service, notes that
        can invoke scripts, among other extra functionality, that's still
        being developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app is still in alpha, UI bugs are to be expected, but the storage
        and backup functionalities should be stable.
